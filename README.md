# Game of Life

## Approach
1. Discuss the instructions with my mentor
1. Search internet for successful and unsuccessful approaches and take inspiration from them
1. Create a skeleton starting point, check into Github, submit link to assessor
1. Iterate on scenarios, committing to Github often, create release points for each successful scenario
1. Document and publish

Discussing the instructions with my mentor I realised these things:
- The grid size is "infinite" meaning my initial throughs of an array wouldn't work due to memory capacity
- There is no requirement to display the grid meaning I can focus on logic before presentation (if at all)
- I should build a solution attempting each scenario in turn, not all at once
- In attempting subsequent scenarios I could break working code for previous scenarios, and that a test driven development approach will be most useful here, something I've heard about but not employed before, so I need to do some reading on that. Because of this, when looking for solutions to take inspiration from them, I will limit my internet search for solutions that use test driven development.
